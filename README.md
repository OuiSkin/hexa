### Work flow/To do list

### Branches

**IMPORTANT:** Our model is based on [A successful Git branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). PLEASE, take the time to read it carefully before starting. We don't want you to mess things up! :)

*	`master` is the stable branch for production.
*	`dev` (origin HEAD) is the development branch for unit/lab tests and behavior development. If the lab tests are concluding, a pull request to the master can be made.
*	`feature branches` are transitory branches used to develop new features to incorporate to the dev branch. When the feature is bug free, a pull request can be made to merge the concluding results inside the dev branch.
*	`oldies` branch keeps all the old code and libraries we used for the first prototype. It is deprecated now but could be helpful for beginners.
